I will be adding all the data that's needed to learn node a bit 
it will also have some data about mongo db and something about ejs
so let's start with git


Setup a node env 
And then start

To setup npm you need to install npm but using
Npm init

And if you have any dependencies in your package.json then you need to use
Npm install → to install all the packages


Git setup follow same stepps

First installing git in the same file

To do that do 
Git init

Next add it to staging process

Git add *

All the files which are not mentioned in .gitignore will be staged

Next commit it to the repo


To do that you use

Git commit -m “what you wanna say”


After that create a branch 

That is main

And then create a remote repo 

Git remote add origin “url” -> http url

And the push using

Git push -u origin main


And for user id => urs is manishreddy255
And for password => refer to access token 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

This will be only valid till nov -21 2021 or create another with valid permissions

Then you can push it

Now we will look into some node

Now we will try to create api and then use it to perform crud ops on the data

In the server only while in routing parameters we have api routes so we use it



All the base steps are common 

Need to require express into the file

And then use it to create app

Const express = require(‘express”)
Const app = express()

So this app is the main point of contact to us, with this only we create everything

So now lets get the middle ware required for encoding and getting the data we entered in the form

app.use(express.urlencoded())

To stringify json data 

app.use(express.json())

App.get to process get requests and app.post to process post requests

This way you can process the requests in the node 


// we’ll now learn how to use to do the work
